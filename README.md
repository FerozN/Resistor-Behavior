# Resistor-Behaviour
This Java assignment involves creating a class called "Resistor" that models the behaviour of electrical resistors. The class allows for the manipulation of resistance, voltage, current, and power properties of resistors while imposing limits on valid parameter values and provides a demonstration of these operations through a main method.

# Bank-Account
This project consists of Java classes, "Account" and "Bank," which create a basic banking system. The "Account" class handles individual accounts with deposit and withdrawal methods, while the "Bank" class manages multiple accounts and checks account number existence. The "MainAccount" and "MainBank" classes demonstrate these functionalities.

# Blackjack
This project involves a simple implementation of a Blackjack game in Java. It consists of classes for cards, card piles, a user interface, and the main game logic. The game allows players to see their and the house's cards, decide whether to take another card and determine the winner based on the card scores. The "SimpleUI" class provides a basic command-line user interface for playing the game.

# Complex-Numbers
This project consists of Java code comprising a "ComplexTry" class that demonstrates complex number operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more using a custom "ComplexNumber" class, providing a complete complex number arithmetic system with print outputs.

# Digit-Counter
This project involves two Java classes, "Counter" and "CounterTry," that demonstrate a counter system with digits and modulus. The "Counter" class represents individual digits and their interactions, while the "CounterTry" class showcases the functionality by incrementing and displaying multi-digit counters.

# Electrical-Circuit
This project represents an electrical circuit using Java classes. It includes components like resistors, nodes, and a circuit manager. The "Circuit" class is a singleton that manages a list of resistors, while the "Resistor" and "Node" classes define the properties and connections of circuit components. The "Test" class demonstrates the creation and interaction of these circuit elements.

# Resistor-Behaviour
This Java assignment project consists of a class called "Resistor" that models the behaviour of electrical resistors. The class allows for the manipulation of resistance, voltage, current, and power properties of resistors while imposing limits on valid parameter values and provides a demonstration of these operations through a main method.
